You need to place the cheat file in the CS2 root folder, or alternatively here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\bin\win64

Then launch your game, wait a few seconds for it to start, and then you can run the script.

dowloads : pip install PySide6 qt-material requests pymem pywin32 pynput
 
and You also need to install pyMeow. Once you've installed all of this, youâ€™ll be ready to cheat.
